# Melanoma Cancer Image Classification

This project focuses on classifying images of skin lesions as either malignant (melanoma) or benign using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, can be deadly if not detected and treated early. Automated classification systems can assist dermatologists in identifying potentially harmful lesions, leading to timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.

## Dataset:

- The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of skin lesions collected from various medical sources and databases.
- Each image is labeled as either "melanoma" or "benign" based on expert diagnosis.
- The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets for model training, validation, and evaluation, respectively.

## Technologies Used:

- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework used for building and training convolutional neural network (CNN) models.
- Keras: High-level neural networks API, used for building and configuring the CNN model architecture.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computing, used for handling numerical data and arrays.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library, used for organizing and preprocessing dataset metadata.
- Matplotlib: Plotting library, used for visualizing images, model performance metrics, and training progress.

## Model Architecture:

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is employed for image classification.
- Multiple convolutional layers are utilized for feature extraction, followed by pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
- Fully connected layers are employed for classification, with softmax activation for predicting class probabilities.

## Training Process:

- The model is trained using a portion of the dataset, with data augmentation techniques applied to improve model generalization and robustness.
- The training process involves optimizing the model parameters using the Adam optimizer and minimizing the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
- Training progress is monitored using validation data, and early stopping may be applied to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation:

- The trained model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other relevant metrics.
- Classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves may be generated to analyze the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Usage:

- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure that the required dependencies are installed (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).
- Follow the instructions provided in the project's README file for setting up the environment, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
