# Image Classification

This repository contains multiple projects related to image classification. Each project focuses on different aspects of image classification techniques using machine learning and deep learning models.

## Projects Included:

### 1. Melanoma Cancer Image Classification

- **Description:** This project aims to classify images of skin lesions as either malignant (melanoma) or benign using machine learning techniques.
- **Dataset:** The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of skin lesions obtained from various sources.
- **Technologies Used:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Model Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple layers for feature extraction and classification.
- **Training Process:** The model is trained using a portion of the dataset while validating the performance on another portion. Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve model generalization.
- **Evaluation:** The trained model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and effectiveness in classifying melanoma images.
- **Results:** Visualizations and metrics such as accuracy, loss, and classification reports are provided to analyze the model's performance.
